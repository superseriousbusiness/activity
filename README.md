**THIS IS FORKED FROM https://github.com/go-fed/activity**!

tl;dr To generate the GtS (and other) schemas:

```
GOPATH=~/go ./astool/astool \
    -spec ./astool/activitystreams.jsonld \
    -spec ./astool/schema.jsonld \
    -spec ./astool/security-v1.jsonld \
    -spec ./astool/toot.jsonld \
    -spec ./astool/gotosocial.jsonld \
    ./streams
```

`go get github.com/go-fed/activity`

This repository contains two libraries and a tool:

* `astool`: A linked-data aware tool to generate golang native types for any
ActivityStreams vocabulary.
* `streams`: The ActivityStreams native types generated with the `astool`.
* `pub`: ActivityPub Social Protocol (Client-to-Server or C2S) and Federating
Protocol (Server-to-Server or S2S)

## Status

**1.0.0** ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/))

This library has been successfully used to
[federate since May 17, 2019](https://cjslep.com/c/blog/this-blog-is-federated).

An [official implementation report](https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/)
was last submitted for version **0.2.0** [here](https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/318).
Unfortunately, the official implementation report tool is no longer maintained.
Previous unofficial implementation reports are available in [issue #46](https://github.com/go-fed/activity/issues/46).

Please see CHANGELOG for changes between versions.

## Getting Started

Check out [go-fed.org](https://go-fed.org/) for tutorials and documentation.

Also, see `astool`, `streams`, or `pub` for their own README.

## FAQ

### What vocabularies are supported?

* [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary).
* A subset of the [toot](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/app/lib/activitypub/adapter.rb) vocabulary.
* A subset of the [security](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/) vocabulary.
* [ForgeFed](https://forgefed.peers.community/vocabulary.html).

### How well tested are these libraries?

I took great care to add numerous tests using examples directly from
specifications, official test repositories, and my own end-to-end tests.

**v1.0.0** has around 200 unit tests. The **federation** or **S2S** portion of
the library is very well tested. The **social** or **C2S** portion could use
additional unit tests, but is far less popular than federation. About 70% of the
lines are covered by unit tests.

### Who is using this library currently?

## Thanks

I would like to thank those that have worked hard to create the technologies
and standards that created the opportunity to implement this suite of
libraries.

Thanks to those who have been early adopters with v0 and/or provided early
feedback.
